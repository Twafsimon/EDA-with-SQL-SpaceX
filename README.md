   Explatory Data AnalysisÂ¶
-  Using SQL queries to manipulate and evaluate the space x data set
-  Use CTE or join to get the total number of  successful and Failure mission Outcomes
-  Use sub-queries to get the List of all the booster versions for Falcon 9  that have carried the maximum payload mass 
- Use the substr() function to deal with date and time datatypes in SQLite because SQLite doesn't support month names
- Rank the count of landing outcomes (such as Failure (drone ship) or Success (ground pad)) between the dates 2010-06-04 and 2017-03-20 in  descending order.
